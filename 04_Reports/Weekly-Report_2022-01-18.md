# Weekly Meeting on January 18, 2022

## What I did

### Creating DFs

1. Download data (in JSON format, between 1990 and 2021) for all reports on the list that is made from the API.
2. Create DFs from the data. 
   + For a specific `slug_name`,
     - A DF includes data only for a specific year.
     - A R list object contains all DFs for the `slug_name`. 
3. Make lists of commodities, market types, and offices from the DFs.



## What I will do

- [ ] Check [Run a Custom Report](https://www.marketnews.usda.gov/mnp/ls-report-config) webpage to all of API-providing information is available form it.
