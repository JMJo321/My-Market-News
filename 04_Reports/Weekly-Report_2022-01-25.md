## What I did

### Creating DFs

1. Download additional data.
   - The API is providing 703 MMN reports.
   - Several reports include no information (e.g., `MD_DA199`).
2. Normalize variable names across MMN reports.
   - For example, 
     -  `average_price` vs `avg_price`
     - `price_max` vs `max_price`
   - Need to be updated in the process of data cleanning. 
3. Make summaries of MMN report data
   - Summary of variable names
   - Summary of values in variables selected



## What I will do

- [ ] Update the summaries by adding publication frequency, etc. 
- [ ] Prioritize commodities
- [ ] Check [Run a Custom Report](https://www.marketnews.usda.gov/mnp/ls-report-config) webpage to all of API-providing information is available form it.
- [ ] Check whether the data available from the [Custom Average Tool](https://cat.ams.usda.gov/app/main#/dashboards/58d7ca1a733656a41a000029?embed=true&l=false&r=false&h=false&t=false&volatile=true) page can be computed from the API-providing data.
